This script moves all files from a given directory into a backup/ folder.

1) It checks that exactly one argument (directory path) is provided.
2) It validates the directory exists.
3) It creates a backup/ folder inside the directory.
4) It loops through all items in the directory and moves only regular files.
5) Each mv runs in the background using '&'.
6) After starting each move, it prints the PID using $!.
7) It uses wait to pause until all background moves finish.
